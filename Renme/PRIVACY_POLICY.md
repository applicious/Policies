# Renme — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-30
**Last updated:** 2025-12-30

## 1) Overview
Renme (“Renme”, “we”, “us”) provides a marketplace app where owners can list items for rent and renters can request bookings. This Policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## 2) Who we are (controller/operator)
**Legal entity name:** `Renme`
**Contact email:** `applicious.app@gmail.com`

If you have questions or requests about privacy, contact us using the details above.

## 3) Information we collect
We collect information in the following categories.

### A) Information you provide
- **Account and identity information:** phone number (for OTP sign-in), email address (if you add or bind one), and display name.
- **Profile information (optional fields):** work, bio title, about-me text, fun fact, languages and interests.
- **Address information:** street address (full), suburb, postcode, and a Google Places identifier (“place id”) when you choose to save an address.
- **Content you upload:** profile photo/avatar, listing photos, and any photos attached to disputes or reports.
- **Communications:** messages and attachments you send to other users through in-app chat, and communications you send to us (e.g., support emails).
- **Booking and marketplace actions:** item listings you create, booking requests, approvals/rejections, cancellations, handover preferences, dispute submissions, and related metadata.

### B) Payment and financial information
- **Payments are processed by Stripe.** We do not store full card numbers.
- We may store **payment-related references** such as Stripe customer IDs, payment method IDs (tokens), Stripe Connect account IDs for payouts, and records of wallet top-ups/withdrawals/holds within our database.
- If Stripe requires identity verification (KYC) for payouts, that information is handled by Stripe and subject to Stripe’s policies.

### C) Device and usage information
- **Device and app information:** platform (iOS/Android), and app events/diagnostics.
- **Push notification tokens:** if you enable push notifications, we store your Expo push token (and platform) to deliver notifications.
- **Diagnostics and error logs:** we may collect error reports and debug information (e.g., crash traces, console logs) to troubleshoot and improve reliability. These logs may include information you entered into the app if it was part of an error message.

### D) Information from third parties
Depending on how you sign in and use the app, we may receive information from:
- **Authentication providers** (e.g., Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In via Supabase): identifiers and basic profile information made available by the provider (such as name and email), subject to your provider settings.
- **Google Maps/Places**: when you search for an address/place, your query and session token are sent to Google Places via our server proxy to return suggestions and place details.

## 4) How we use your information
We use personal information to:
- **Provide the service** (create accounts, authenticate users, create listings, process bookings, enable chat, and support disputes).
- **Process payments and payouts** (wallet top-ups, holds, captures, refunds, and withdrawals) through Stripe and our backend systems.
- **Enable addresses and maps features** (autocomplete addresses, show approximate locations, and facilitate handovers).
- **Send notifications and service messages** (push, email, and SMS), such as booking updates, receipts, and security messages.
- **Improve safety and prevent misuse** (fraud prevention, rate limiting, abuse detection, and enforcing platform rules).
- **Monitor and improve reliability** (debugging, performance analysis, and incident response).
- **Comply with legal obligations** and respond to lawful requests.

## 5) How we share your information
We share personal information in the following ways.

### A) With other users (marketplace visibility)
- **Public listing content:** when you publish a listing, information like listing photos, title, description, category, price, and general area information may be visible to other users (and potentially to the public in future web surfaces).
- **Profile information:** depending on the app surfaces, some profile fields (such as suburb and postcode) may be visible to other users.
- **Handover and address privacy:** we aim to minimize exposure of full street addresses in public views. In many cases, only suburb/postcode or approximate location is shown until it’s needed for a booking handover.
- **Chat:** messages you send are shared with the recipient(s).

### B) With service providers (processors)
We use third-party vendors to operate the app. These providers process information on our behalf, subject to their own terms and privacy policies:
- **Supabase** (authentication, database, storage, and edge functions).
- **Stripe** (payments, wallet top-ups, and payouts/Stripe Connect).
- **Google Maps Platform / Google Places** (address autocomplete and place details).
- **Expo / Apple / Google** (push notification delivery infrastructure; depending on platform).
- **Twilio** (SMS/phone verification and other SMS notifications, where enabled).
- **Resend** (transactional emails, where enabled).

### C) For legal, safety, and business reasons
We may disclose information:
- To comply with laws, regulations, and lawful requests.
- To enforce our Terms, investigate fraud/abuse, or protect the safety of users and the public.
- In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets (in which case we will take reasonable steps to notify you and/or update this Policy).

## 6) Data retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to:
- Provide the service and maintain your account.
- Comply with legal, tax, accounting, and reporting obligations (especially for payments and transactions).
- Resolve disputes and enforce agreements.

**Retention periods vary by data type** (e.g., account data vs. transaction records vs. logs). If you request deletion, some information may still be retained where required or permitted by law.

## 7) Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal information, including access controls and encrypted connections. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8) Your choices and rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to:
- **Access, correct, or update** your personal information.
- **Delete** your account and/or request deletion of certain information (subject to legal retention requirements).
- **Opt out** of non-essential notifications (where available). You can also control push notification permissions in your device settings.

To exercise these rights, contact us at `applicious.app@gmail.com`.

## 9) International data transfers
Our service providers may process and store information in Australia and other countries. Where required, we take steps designed to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers.

## 10) Children’s privacy
Renme is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

## 11) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice in the app.
