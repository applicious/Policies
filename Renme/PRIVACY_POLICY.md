# Renme — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2026-01-03
**Last updated:** 2026-01-03

## 1) Overview
Renme (“Renme”, “we”, “us”) provides a marketplace app where owners can list items for rent and renters can request bookings. This Policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## 2) Who we are (controller/operator)
**Privacy contact email:** `support@renme.app`

If you have questions or requests about privacy, contact us using the details above.

## 3) Information we collect
We collect information in the following categories. Some information is required to create an account and use key features. If you do not provide required information, we may not be able to provide the service (or parts of it), such as creating a listing, requesting a booking, making a payment, or withdrawing earnings.

### A) Information you provide
- **Account information (required):** phone number (for OTP sign-in) and email address (to complete account setup), and a display name (so other users can identify you in the marketplace).
- **Profile information (optional):** work, bio title, about-me text, fun fact, languages and interests. If you do not provide these fields, your profile will show less information.
- **Address information (optional, but required for some features):** street address (full), suburb, postcode, and a Google Places identifier (“place id”) when you choose to save an address. If you do not provide an address, you may not be able to use address-based handover options or save an address to your profile.
- **Content you upload (optional, but required for some features):** profile photo/avatar, listing photos (required to publish certain listings), and any photos attached to disputes or reports.
- **Communications:** messages and attachments you send to other users through in-app chat (required if you use chat), and communications you send to us (for example, support requests).
- **Booking and marketplace actions:** item listings you create, booking requests, approvals/rejections, cancellations, handover preferences, dispute submissions, and related metadata (generated when you use those features).

### B) Payment and financial information
- **Payments are processed by Stripe.** We do not store full card numbers.
- **Required to pay or withdraw:** if you top up your wallet, request bookings, pay rental charges, or withdraw earnings as an owner, you will need to provide payment or payout information to Stripe (for example, card details for top ups, and bank account/KYC details for payouts via Stripe Connect).
- We may store **payment-related references** such as Stripe customer IDs, payment method IDs (tokens), Stripe Connect account IDs for payouts, and records of wallet top-ups/withdrawals/holds within our database.
- If Stripe requires identity verification (KYC) for payouts, that information is handled by Stripe and subject to Stripe’s policies.

### C) Device and usage information
- **Device and app information:** platform (iOS/Android), and app events/diagnostics.
- **Push notification tokens (optional):** if you enable push notifications, we store your Expo push token (and platform) to deliver notifications. If you do not enable push notifications, we will not send push messages to your device.
- **Diagnostics and error logs:** we may collect error reports and debug information (for example, crash traces and console logs) to troubleshoot and improve reliability. These logs may include information you entered into the app if it was part of an error message.

### D) Information from third parties
Depending on how you sign in and use the app, we may receive information from:
- **Authentication providers** (e.g., Google Sign-In, Apple Sign-In via Supabase): identifiers and basic profile information made available by the provider (such as name and email), subject to your provider settings.
- **Google Maps/Places**: when you search for an address/place, your query and session token are sent to Google Places via our server proxy to return suggestions and place details.

## 4) How we use your information
We use personal information to:
- **Provide the service** (create accounts, authenticate users, create listings, process bookings, enable chat, and support disputes).
- **Process payments and payouts** (wallet top-ups, holds, captures, refunds, and withdrawals) through Stripe and our backend systems.
- **Enable addresses and maps features** (autocomplete addresses, show approximate locations, and facilitate handovers).
- **Send notifications and service messages** (push, email, and SMS), such as booking updates, receipts, and security messages.
- **Improve safety and prevent misuse** (fraud prevention, rate limiting, abuse detection, and enforcing platform rules).
- **Monitor and improve reliability** (debugging, performance analysis, and incident response).
- **Comply with legal obligations** and respond to lawful requests.

## 5) How we share your information
We share personal information in the following ways.

### A) With other users (marketplace visibility)
- **Public listing content:** when you publish a listing, information like listing photos, title, description, category, price, and general area information may be visible to other users (and potentially to the public in future web surfaces).
- **Profile information:** depending on the app surfaces, some profile fields (such as suburb and postcode) may be visible to other users.
- **Handover and address privacy:** we aim to minimize exposure of full street addresses in public views. In many cases, only suburb/postcode or approximate location is shown until it’s needed for a booking handover.
- **Chat:** messages you send are shared with the recipient(s).

### B) With service providers (processors)
We use third-party vendors to operate the app. These providers process information on our behalf, subject to their own terms and privacy policies:
- **Supabase** (authentication, database, storage, and edge functions).
- **Stripe** (payments, wallet top-ups, and payouts/Stripe Connect).
- **Google Maps Platform / Google Places** (address autocomplete and place details).
- **Expo / Apple / Google** (push notification delivery infrastructure; depending on platform).
- **Twilio** (SMS/phone verification and other SMS notifications, where enabled).
- **Resend** (transactional emails, where enabled).

### C) For legal, safety, and business reasons
We may disclose information:
- To comply with laws, regulations, and lawful requests.
- To enforce our Terms, investigate fraud/abuse, or protect the safety of users and the public.
- In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets (in which case we will take reasonable steps to notify you and/or update this Policy).

## 6) Data retention
We retain personal information for as long as necessary to:
- Provide the service and maintain your account.
- Comply with legal, tax, accounting, and reporting obligations (especially for payments and transactions).
- Resolve disputes and enforce agreements.

**Retention periods vary by data type** (e.g., account data vs. transaction records vs. logs). If you request deletion, some information may still be retained where required or permitted by law.

## 7) Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect personal information, including access controls and encrypted connections. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8) Your choices and rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to:
- **Access, correct, or update** your personal information.
- **Delete** your account and/or request deletion of certain information (subject to legal retention requirements).
- **Opt out** of non-essential notifications (where available). You can also control push notification permissions in your device settings.

### Australia: access/correction and complaints
If you are in Australia, you can request access to or correction of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us at `support@renme.app`. We may ask you to verify your identity before we act on a request. We will respond within a reasonable time and may refuse a request in limited circumstances permitted by law.

If you have a complaint about how we handle personal information, contact us at `support@renme.app` with details of your complaint. We will acknowledge and investigate your complaint and try to resolve it promptly. If you are not satisfied with our response, you may be able to complain to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).

## 9) International data transfers
Our service providers may process and store information in Australia and other countries. Where required, we take steps designed to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers.

## 10) Children’s privacy
Renme is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

## 11) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will update the “Last updated” date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice in the app.
