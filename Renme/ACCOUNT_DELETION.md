# Renme — Account and Data Deletion Instructions

**Effective date:** 2026-01-03  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-03

## 1) Overview
This page explains how to request deletion of your Renme account and associated personal information.

Renme is operated by **[LEGAL_ENTITY_NAME]** (ABN **[ABN]**, ACN **[ACN]** (if applicable)) of **[ADDRESS]** (“Renme”, “we”, “us”).

## 2) How to request deletion
To request deletion of your Renme account, email **support@renme.app**.

Use this email subject line:
- **Subject:** `Account Deletion Request – Renme`

Include all of the following in the email body so we can verify and process your request:
- The **email address** linked to your Renme account
- Your **full name** (as shown in your Renme profile)
- Your **date of birth** (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Your **phone number** used to sign in (if different from what you’re emailing from)
- If relevant: any **active booking IDs** or **recent booking dates** (to help us locate your account faster)

## 3) Verification and security
For your security, we only process deletion requests after we can reasonably verify the request relates to the account holder. We will verify using:
- the **email address the request is sent from**, and
- the **full name** and **date of birth** you provide, matched against available account records.

We may ask for additional verification if we cannot confirm identity from the details provided.

**Do not email sensitive payment information.** Please do not send credit card numbers, bank account numbers, passwords, or copies of identification documents by email. We will not ask you to email these.

## 4) What we will delete
Once verified, we will take steps to delete or de-identify your personal information associated with your Renme account where reasonably possible, such as:
- your profile details (for example: display name, bio fields, saved addresses)
- your device/push token registrations
- your listings (or we will remove public visibility and de-identify them where deletion would break marketplace integrity)
- your in-app content that is reasonably able to be removed or de-identified

## 5) What we may keep (legal and operational retention)
We may retain certain information where required or permitted by law or for legitimate business purposes, including:
- records required for **tax, accounting, fraud prevention, chargebacks, disputes, and compliance** (including payment and wallet transaction records)
- records required to enforce our Terms or resolve disputes between users
- security and audit logs retained for a limited period

Where we retain information, we will take reasonable steps to minimise personal information retained (for example, by de-identifying it where appropriate).

Nothing on this page excludes, restricts or modifies any consumer guarantees or other rights under the Australian Consumer Law or other applicable laws that cannot be excluded.

## 6) Timing and constraints
- We aim to complete verified deletion requests within **30 days**.
- If you have **active bookings, unresolved disputes, pending refunds/chargebacks, pending withdrawals, or a non‑zero wallet balance**, we may need to delay deletion until those matters are resolved or we may contact you for next steps.

## 7) Complaints and escalation (Australia)
If you have a complaint about how we handle your deletion request or personal information, email **support@renme.app** with:
- **Subject:** `Privacy Complaint – Renme`
- details of your complaint and what outcome you are seeking.

If you are not satisfied with our response, you may be able to complain to the **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)**.
